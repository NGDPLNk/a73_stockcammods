## v1.1 for OneUI 6.X Changelog

- Added and enabled FHD Auto FPS video modes by default. This are different from the config 'Auto FPS' options but achieve a similar result.

- Disabled Super Steady for UHD recording due to incompatibilities (Issues reported by [@Saddam ameghchouche](https://xdaforums.com/m/saddam-ameghchouche.9644798/)).

Enjoy :)
